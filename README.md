# Classify_Headline_DPHI_Datathon
Jupyter notebook on a challenge part of NLP Bootcamp at DPHI.

The data necessary is uploaded here.

It is a bit ram consuming so Id advise running on Kaggle.

The biggest challenge is data processing. NLP is very data processing intensive as it is in this stage that youÂ´ll turn your data into a way the selected algorith
will "understand" text and context.
